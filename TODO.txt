-levels
	-general variety, fleshing out
	-an overworld map would be fantastic; like 5 worlds with 3 levels each
	-moar textures
-audio
	-literally everything left to do; sfx and music
-collectibles
	-more textures/animations
	-anything other than gems?
-infra
	-stats object(s) for player actions
	-credit open art sources
-ui
	-design needs improvement, currently generic, without style
	-better font
	-generic function buttons (restart current level, exit, return to menu, etc)
	-dialog? cutscenes? probably not worth it in this scope
	-pause script would be good to integrate with hud or pause menu
	-finish controller support
